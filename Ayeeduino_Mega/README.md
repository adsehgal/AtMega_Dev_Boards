# Ayeeduino Mega
## With AtMega16U2 for serial communication

</p>This is a custom Arduino type development board that houses the AtMega2560 and can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. In order to succesfully program the board, first you need to flash the bootloader on both the MCUs using either the Arduino IDE or Nick Gammons Bootloader Programmer:</p>

</p>The gerber files can be sent to JLCPCB for manufacturing since they agree with their constraints and the components can be ordered via LCSC using the BOM provided.</p>
Goals:
 <ol>

 - Reduce the physical size of the Arduino Mega by roughly half.

 - Implement USB-C for future proofing.

 - Remove unnecessary components.
